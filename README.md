# discordbotproject

Everything you need to know for your discord bot stored here.


# What goes inside of the .env file?
The values you will need are:
DISCORD_TOKEN=whatever your bot token is.  
When using tokens make sure that you get the BOTS token and not the 'application' token as defined by discord developer portal.

You will also need:
DISCORD_GUILD=whatever your channel name is.

Please remember that the tokens are case sensitive.  Also try to make sure that your guild name is case sensitive as well just to be safe.  

The words below are in all caps.
DISCORD_TOKEN
DISCORD_GUILD

# How are the Formulas Figured?
